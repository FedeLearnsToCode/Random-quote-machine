## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- Bootstrap 5 for styling and responsiveness
- Marked for Markdown parsing
- DOMPurify for security (to prevent unsafe code)
- CSS @keyframe for animations

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Notes 

- I used React 17 because React 18 has some issues with FreeCodeCamp tests.
- Security is important, so I sanitize the HTML before displaying it.
- Everything works locally, no server needed.
- To ensure that FreeCodeCamp's tests run correctly on GitHub Pages, I had to **embed the `app.js` logic directly inside the `index.html` file** using a `<script type="text/babel">` tag. This approach avoids issues with the test bundle not recognizing required elements like `#editor` and `#preview`.
